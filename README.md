# MDP GIMP Plugin

An attempt to add MDIPack support to GIMP via plugin.

This is based on my work on [krita-plugin-mdp](https://github.com/weeb-poly/krita-plugin-mdp).

I am currently using libgimp3 and MSYS2 MINGW64. This plugin is probably going
to remain incomplete until GIMP 3 has a release date.
